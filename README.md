# Think Brownstone Peeps:

Thanks for taking the time to review my code! This was a nice break from my backend nonsense.

This was a cool assignment, and *super* coherent. Compared to some other assignments, I knew what you were looking for right from the get-go. I'm glad to gain some insight into Think Brownstone's development mentality – always pumped to see code standards – and it was a challenge to do some work *without* a CSS framework for a change.

I didn't use too many of the tools that I normally do (webpack/react/mithril) because I see that you mentioned gulp and jquery in your docs, so I wanted to show that I have some experience working with those as well.

I'm most comfortable with SASS, but I tried to make it as close to what you're looking for as expressed in your CSS coding standards.

Let me know what you think! This should be as simple as

    git clone http://github.com/hooph00p/septa-fare-calculator && cd septa-fare-calculator && npm i

(for those of us on OSX/Linux)

Have a great New Year!

- Jared
